console.log(greeting);

var greeting = 'Hello world';

//answer: The above code returns 'undefined'. Variables declarations with 'var' are hoisted to the top of the code.  Thus, while
//        the declaration is hoisted, the value is not. Accordingly, the code logs undefined and not 'Hello world'.
