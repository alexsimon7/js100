Original answer:

Yes, an error will occur when trying to access an array element with an index that is greater or equal to the
length of an array because indexing for an array starts at the number 0 for the first slot rather than number one.
Thus, an index location of 3 would point to the fourth element which does not exist in this array and is outside the 
index.

Corrected answer:
Unlike Python, when attempting to index outside and array in JS, JS will return undefined. Anything outside of 
index 0, 1, or 2 will return undefined.
