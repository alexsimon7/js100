3. This code infinitly loops because the conditional part of the 'while' loop assigns counter to 1 each loop rather
than test whether counter equals 1.  The assignment 'counter = 1' is truthy, meaning the condition of the 'while' 
loop is always true. Further, because of the reassignement of counter to 1 every loop, the code never progresses its
counter past the value of 2. Accordingly, the code never reaches the break statement in the nested 'if' statement.

4. There is no error in this code because all three requirements for a 'for' loop are present: the initialization,
condition, and increment(even though the increment does not appear above in the for statement, it does appear in 
the code block below). The code would log 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
